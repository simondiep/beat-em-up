# beat-em-up

Simple Beat-em-up game using HTML5 Canvas

Still in-progress - currently a basic box collision detector

![demo preview](./preview.gif?raw=true)

# How to start

npm i && npm start

## TODO

- Add image with depth
- Tune attack hit box to respect z-axis
- Punch image
- Figure out why non-standard sized enemies don't detect attack collision
